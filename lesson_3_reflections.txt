When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
 When the chances of my computer exploding are high.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
 In case someone less talented then me (not that they exist) messes up the stuff on the remote repository.
