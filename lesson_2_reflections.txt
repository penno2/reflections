 A .git directory is created. So that git "knows" to track the stuff in here.
 
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
 The staging area is part of the repository and contains things from the working directory to be committed. Enables bundling of files for a particular commit.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
 By running git diff -staging
